### [fman](https://fman.io/)

#### Install using Git

If you are a git user, you can install the theme and keep up to date by cloning the repo:

    $ git clone https://github.com/dracula/template.git

#### Install manually

Download using the [GitHub .zip download](https://github.com/dracula/template/archive/master.zip) option and unzip them.

#### Activating theme

You will need to manually replace the files as follows:
- styles.qss goes in C:\Users\<username>\AppData\Local\fman\Versions\<version>
- theme.css goes in C:\Users\<username>\AppData\Local\fman\Versions\<version>\Plugins\Core

Unfortunatly there is no easy way to keep your changes. If fman is updated you will need to chnage the code again.

IF you know how to make setting up the theme easier, please help :)
