### [fman](https://fman.io/)

#### Installing and activating the theme

You will need to manually replace the files as follows:
- styles.qss goes in C:\Users\<username>\AppData\Local\fman\Versions\<version>
- theme.css goes in C:\Users\<username>\AppData\Local\fman\Versions\<version>\Plugins\Core

I have also uploaded the files, so you can copy and paste the code as well.

Unfortunatly there is no easy way to keep your changes. If fman is updated, you will need to change the code again. This is a fman limitation at the moment.

If you know how to make setting up the theme easier, please help :)
