### [fman](https://fman.io/)

#### Installing and activating the theme

You will need to manually replace the files as follows:
- [styles.qss](https://github.com/sf-pear/dracula-for-fman/blob/master/styles.qss) goes in C:\Users\\**your_username**\AppData\Local\fman\Versions\\**your_version**
- [theme.css](https://github.com/sf-pear/dracula-for-fman/blob/master/Theme.css) goes in C:\Users\\**your_username**\AppData\Local\fman\Versions\\**your_version**\Plugins\Core

Unfortunatly there is no easy way to keep your changes. If fman is updated, you will need to change the code again. This is a fman limitation at the moment.

If you know how to make setting up the theme easier, please help :)
